This is a comprehensive README.md file tailored for your ORION | Control Tower project. It incorporates the project objectives, technical execution, innovative features (like the "Self-Healing" pipeline), and the business impact of your analysis.🛰️ ORION | Logistics Intelligence Control TowerORION is an integrated logistics command center designed to transform raw data into actionable intelligence. By unifying seven disparate datasets—from warehouse inventory to real-time traffic delays—ORION provides a 360-degree view of operational efficiency, sustainability, and customer risk.📌 Problem StatementModern logistics ecosystems suffer from "Data Silos." Vehicle performance is tracked separately from customer feedback, and environmental impact is often an afterthought rather than a core metric. This lack of integration leads to:Invisible Revenue at Risk: High-value orders delayed by traffic without proactive intervention.Unmonitored Carbon Footprints: No real-time link between vehicle choice and emission hotspots.Reactive Service Recovery: Identifying customer dissatisfaction only after a rating is submitted.The Solution: ORION bridges these gaps with an intelligent, self-healing dashboard that predicts risks and optimizes for both Profit (Cost) and Planet (CO2).🛠️ Innovation: The "Self-Healing" PipelineORION features a robust backend designed for the messy reality of supply chain data.Dynamic Column Injection: Automatically detects missing critical columns (like vehicle_type) and uses weighted random distribution from the fleet file to maintain data integrity.Standardization Layer: A universal sanitization engine that handles inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., "CO2 Emissions" vs "carbon_kg") across multiple CSV sources.Feature Engineering:CLV Score: Calculates Customer Lifetime Value dynamically:$$CLV\_Score = \left( \frac{Order\_Value}{Max\_Value} \times 70 \right) + \left( \frac{Customer\_Rating}{5} \times 30 \right)$$Carbon Impact: Precision tracking of emissions:$$Carbon\_Impact = Distance \times CO2\_Factor_{vehicle\_type}$$Service Recovery %: Real-time ratio of Low-Risk vs. High-Risk shipments based on traffic volatility.📊 Dashboard Features1. Geospatial Carbon & Emission HotspotsUsing PyDeck high-fidelity mapping, ORION visualizes "Emission Hotspots." The heatmap density is driven by the Carbon_Impact metric, allowing managers to see exactly where the fleet is most inefficient.2. Risk Propensity Matrix (Scatter Plot)An interactive Plotly chart that plots Distance vs. Cost, where:Bubble Size: Represents CLV_Score (Prioritizing high-value customers).Color: Indicates Risk_Level (Based on traffic and weather).3. AI Intervention AgentA logic-driven module that scans the environment for "High Risk" orders. It suggests immediate rerouting or carrier intervention for deliveries where the revenue at risk exceeds threshold limits.🏗️ Technical ArchitectureFrontend: Streamlit (UI/UX), Plotly (Interactivity), PyDeck (Mapping).Backend: Pandas (Data Wrangling), NumPy (Predictive Logic).Data Storage: 7-Layered CSV Ecosystem (orders, fleet, performance, routes, inventory, costs, feedback).🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.8+Requirements: pandas, numpy, streamlit, plotly, pydeckInstallationClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/ORION-Project.git
cd ORION-Project
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Control Tower:Bashstreamlit run frontend/app.py
📈 Business Impact & ROISustainability: Reduced Carbon Footprint by identifying high-emission routes for EV transition (tracked via the "EV Shift" slider).Operational Resilience: Proactive "Service Recovery" allows for a potential 15-20% reduction in Revenue at Risk by rerouting orders before they fail.Efficiency: Integrated warehouse-to-fleet visibility reduces "Cost Leakage" by matching asset capacity to order volume.📂 Project StructurePlaintextORION_Project/
